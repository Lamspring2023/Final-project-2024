# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

fight or flight the tales of a journey

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game that you play with left and right movement like shovelknight. maybe a roguelike/game or story rpg(can't decide)

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?
This software will make you play a game. It will be similar to shovelknight. I will use unreal engine 5 to build the game. It would have a playable character and enemies to kill. It will also have something at the end to collect to move on.


## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?
I don't think that it can help any other course

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Got none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

I define a good outcome will be a playable character, a background, enemies and a way to kill the enemies and a end point

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

the better outcome will be having a Hud system impleid and items.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a fully funcation game with a map system roguelike game with all the prerequesites

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will start with making a 2d plane and have a playable character and enemies. Might be over achieving with the topic, however I will research all that I can about 2d games using unreal engine 5. I will learn how something will go wrong and might need to adapt to change it or scratch it out entirely. I think the easy parts will be the characters and end point while the hard part will be making a 2d plane to put stuff on. I will also try to figure out what weapon will they have.
